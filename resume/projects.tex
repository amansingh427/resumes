          \item Paper name: \textcolor{awesome}{\underline{\href{https://openreview.net/forum?id=kXy0HAnah0-}{Investigating the Impact of Experience on a User's Ability to Perform Hierarchical Abstraction}}}
          \item Co-authored a paper published in Robotics: Science and Systems investigating how to correctly instruct non-roboticist to perform demonstrations for robots to learn via LfD models. Nominated for best student paper in RSS 2023.
          \item Second author in compilation paper (which also features previous study that this paper followed up on) published in the International Journal of Robotics Research: {\underline{\href{https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02783649241301075?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.1}{Investigating strategies enabling novice users to teach plannable hierarchical tasks to robots}}}
